# Welcome to Slides
A terminal based presentation tool

~~~

## Everything is markdown
In fact this entire presentation is a markdown file

~~~

# Markdown components
You can use everything in markdown!
* Like bulleted list
* You know the deal

1. Numbered lists too

| Tables | Too    |
| ------ | ------ |
| Even   | Tables |

~~~

All you need to do is separate slides with triple tildes `\~\~\~`,
Like so:

```markdown
Slide 1

\~\~\~

Slide 2
```
